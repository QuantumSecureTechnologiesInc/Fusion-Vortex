# Chapter 19: Security and Post-Quantum Cryptography

In an era where quantum computers threaten to break traditional encryption (RSA, ECC), security must be proactive, not reactive. Fusion is designed with **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** at its core. It also emphasizes memory safety (eliminating buffer overflows) and type safety to prevent common vulnerabilities.

In this chapter, we will cover:
- Fusion's PQC standard library (`fusion_security`).
- Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEM) like Kyber.
- Digital Signatures (DSA) like Dilithium.
- Secure coding practices in Fusion.

## 19.1 Why Post-Quantum Cryptography?

Shor's Algorithm allows a sufficiently powerful quantum computer to factor large integers and solve discrete logarithm problems efficiently. This effectively breaks:
- RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)
- Diffie-Hellman
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

These are the bedrock of the current internet (HTTPS, SSH, VPNs).

Fusion adopts the **NIST PQC Standardization** algorithms directly into its standard library to ensure today's data remains secure against tomorrow's computers ("Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" threats).

## 19.2 Key Encapsulation with Kyber

**ML-KEM (Kyber)** is a lattice-based algorithm for key encapsulation. It allows two parties to agree on a shared secret over an insecure channel, even if the adversary has a quantum computer.

### 19.2.1 Generating a Keypair

```fusion
use fusion_security::pqc::kyber
use fusion_security::rand::SecureRng

fn main() {
    let mut rng = SecureRng::new()
    
    // Alice generates a keypair
    let (pk, sk) = kyber::keypair_1024(&mut rng).expect("Keygen failed")
    
    // pk: Public Key (send to Bob)
    // sk: Secret Key (keep safe!)
}
```

### 19.2.2 Encapsulation and Decapsulation

```fusion
    // Bob receives Alice's Public Key (pk)
    // He encapsulates a shared secret
    let (ciphertext, shared_secret_bob) = kyber::encapsulate_1024(&pk, &mut rng)
        .expect("Encap failed")
    
    // Bob sends `ciphertext` to Alice
    
    // Alice uses her Secret Key (sk) to decapsulate
    let shared_secret_alice = kyber::decapsulate_1024(&ciphertext, &sk)
        .expect("Decap failed")
        
    assert_eq!(shared_secret_bob, shared_secret_alice)
    println("Secure channel established!")
}
```

This shared secret can now be used as a key for symmetric encryption (like AES-256 or ChaCha20), which are quantum-resistant.

## 19.3 Digital Signatures with Dilithium

**ML-DSA (Dilithium)** is used for authentication and signing.

### 19.3.1 Signing a Message

```fusion
use fusion_security::pqc::dilithium

fn main() {
    let (pk, sk) = dilithium::keypair_5(&mut SecureRng::new()).unwrap()
    
    let message = b"Authorize transaction #9921"
    
    // Sign the message
    let signature = dilithium::sign_5(message, &sk)
    
    // Verify the signature
    let valid = dilithium::verify_5(message, &signature, &pk)
    
    assert!(valid)
}
```

## 19.4 Hybrid Cryptography

Transitioning to PQC takes time. A "hybrid" approach combines a classical algorithm (like X25519) with a post-quantum one (like Kyber). The system remains secure if *either* is unbreakable.

Fusion's TLS stack supports `X25519Kyber768Draft00` by default.

```fusion
use fusion_net::tls::{TlsConfig, TlsVersion}

fn configure_server() -> TlsConfig {
    TlsConfig::builder()
        .with_versions(&[TlsVersion::Tls13])
        .with_key_exchange_groups(&["x25519_kyber768"])
        .build()
        .unwrap()
}
```

## 19.5 Secure Coding Practices

Beyond algorithms, Fusion's language features promote security.

### 19.5.1 Memory Safety
As discussed in Chapter 4, Fusion eliminates buffer overflows, use-after-free, and double-free errors. This kills an entire class of exploits (like Heartbleed).

### 19.5.2 Type State Pattern for Security

You can use Fusion's type system to enforce security states.

```fusion
struct Unauthenticated;
struct Authenticated;

struct User<State> {
    username: String,
    state: State,
}

impl User<Unauthenticated> {
    fn new(name: String) -> Self {
        User { username: name, state: Unauthenticated }
    }
    
    fn login(self, password: &str) -> Option<User<Authenticated>> {
        if check_password(&self.username, password) {
            Some(User { username: self.username, state: Authenticated })
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}

impl User<Authenticated> {
    fn view_sensitive_data(&self) {
        println!("Secret: 42")
    }
}

fn main() {
    let u = User::new("admin".into())
    // u.view_sensitive_data() // Compile Error! Unauthenticated users have no such method.
    
    if let Some(auth_u) = u.login("password123") {
        auth_u.view_sensitive_data() // OK
    }
}
```

### 19.5.3 Zeroizing Memory

Sensitive data (keys, passwords) should be wiped from memory when dropped.

```fusion
use fusion_security::Zeroize

#[derive(Zeroize)]
#[zeroize(drop)] // Automatically wipe on drop
struct SecretKey {
    key_bytes: [u8; 32],
}
```

## 19.6 Summary

Fusion treats security as a first-class citizen.
- **PQC Standard**: Native support for Kyber and Dilithium.
- **Memory Safety**: Solves classical overflow exploits.
- **Type Safety**: Enforces valid security states at compile time.

By using Fusion, you are essentially "future-proofing" your application against the quantum threat.

## 19.7 Exercises

1.  **Secure Chat**: Build a simple chat client that performs a Kyber handshake to establish a shared key, then encrypts messages with ChaCha20Poly1305.
2.  **Signature Verifier**: Create a CLI tool that takes a file, a signature, and a public key, and verifies if the file was signed by the key owner.
3.  **Type-State**: Implement a `File` wrapper that requires a `scan_for_virus()` method to be called before `read()` becomes available (using the type state pattern).
